<h5>2. STILL THE FASTEST SCREEN IN MOBILE GAMING</h5>

<h5>4. STAY COOL IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE</h5>
<p>You can’t play hard without the hardware. We’ve engineered a cooling system that efficiently sustains<br>
higher average frame rates, for a cooler and more comfortable experience, whether you’re in an extended<br>
gaming session or running multiple apps at the same time.</p>

<h5>5. VAPOR CHAMBER COOLING</h5>
<p>The Razer Phone 2 features a Snapdragon 845 2.8GHz processor, with a vapor-chamber cooling system<br>
that allows heat to spread throughout the phone via a custom vapor chamber which vastly increases<br>
the surface area for heat to dissipate, resulting in fewer hot spots. This allows greater performance<br>
and stability compared to traditional cooling methods.</p>

<h5>6. LET YOUR CREATIVE EYE TAKE OVER</h5>
<p>Create stunning photographs and video with the Razer Phone 2. Featuring dual lenses with dual Sony<br>
IMX Sensors and a wide lens with optical image stabilization. Capture picture-perfect moments with larger<br>
pixels and acute color accuracy, even in low light conditions. The front camera supports FHD video for<br>
sharp face cam footage while streaming or chatting.</p>
