<p>In his first interview of 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on a variety of issues<br>
ranging from surgical strikes to demonetisation, and from the Ram temple issue to that of<br>
triple talaq and Sabarimala protests.</p>
<p>In the nearly 95-minute-long interview with news agency ANI, PM Modi also targeted the<br>
Congress party’s farm loan waivers that had been announced in the three states that the<br>
party won in the recent assembly elections.</p>

<h4>On surgical strikes</h4>
<p>Speaking at length on the surgical strikes that the Indian Army had carried out across the<br>
border in Pakistan, he said he was full of anxiety while the operation was on.</p>
<p>“I gave clear orders that whether you get success or failure, don’t think about that but come<br>
back before sunrise. Don’t fall for the lure and prolong it (the operation). I knew it was a big<br>
risk. The biggest consideration for me was the safety of our soldiers. In the morning,<br>
information flow stopped, for an hour. My anxiety increased. Even one hour after sunrise.<br>
That time was extremely difficult for me... Then came the information that they have not<br>
reached back yet but two-three units have reached the safe zone, so don’t worry. But I said I<br>
won’t be fine till the last man returns,” he said.</p>

<h4>On Pakistan</h4>
<p>To say that Pakistan would behave after losing a fight would be a mistake, he said.</p>
<p>“Ek ladai se Pakistan sudhar jayega, yeh sochne mein bahut badi galti hogi. Pakistan ko<br>
sudarne mein abhi aur samay lagega (It will be a big mistake to think that Pakistan will start<br>
behaving after one fight. It will take a long time for Pakistan to start behaving),” he said.</p>

<h4>On Ram Mandir</h4>
<p>Reiterating that the Ram temple was part of the BJP manifesto and that the party was<br>
committed to finding a solution to the issue within the framework of the Constitution, PM<br>
Modi said, that the government will do what is necessary only after the judicial process gets<br>
over.</p>
<p>“We have said in our BJP manifesto that a solution would be found to this issue under the<br>
ambit of the Constitution. Let the judicial process be over. After the judicial process is over,<br>
whatever will be our responsibility as the government, we are ready to make all efforts,” he<br>
added.</p>

<h4>On triple talaq and Sabarimala</h4>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to compare the triple talaq bill to the Sabarimala<br>
issue saying that while one was a matter of gender equality, the other was a matter of<br>
tradition.</p>
<p>“Most Islamic countries have banned Triple Talaq. So it is not a matter of religion or faith.<br>
Even in Pakistan, Triple Talaq is banned. So it is an issue of gender equality, matter of social<br>
justice. It is not an issue of faith. So keep the two separate,” he said.</p>
<p>On the contentious Sabarimala temple issue, he said, “There are some temples, which have<br>
their own traditions, where men can’t go. And men don’t go... In this, Sabrimala, a woman<br>
judge in the Supreme Court has made certain observations. It needs to be read minutely.<br>
There is no need to attribute those to any political party. As a woman, she has made some<br>
suggestions. There should be a debate on that as well sometimes.”</p>

<h4>On Demonetisation</h4>
<p>PM Modi rejected the claim that the demonetisation move by the government in 2016 had<br>
come as a shock, he said, “This wasn’t a jhatka. We had warned people a year before, that if<br>
you have such wealth (black money), you can deposit it, pay penalties and you will be helped<br>
out. However, they thought Modi too would behave like others so very few came forward<br>
voluntarily.”</p>
