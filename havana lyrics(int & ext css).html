<pre><h2><i><mark>Chorus:-</mark><br> 
&nbsp; Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
&nbsp; Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
&nbsp; He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
&nbsp; Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
&nbsp; There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
&nbsp; Havana, ooh na-na (uh)</i></h2></pre>

<sub>&nbsp;   (When he came in the room)</sub><br>
&nbsp;   He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)<br>
<sub>&nbsp;   (But I can't without you)</sub><br>
&nbsp;   I knew him forever in a minute (hey)<br>

&nbsp; Jeffery..Just graduated, fresh on campus, mm
&nbsp; Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
&nbsp; Fresh out East Atlanta
&nbsp; Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
&nbsp; Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ay)
&nbsp; Back it on me, shawty cravin' on me
&nbsp; Get to diggin' on me (on me)
&nbsp; She waited on me (then what?)</pre></h2></p>
